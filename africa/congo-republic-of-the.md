# Congo, Republic of the

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo. From 1968 to 1992, the country was named the People&rsquo;s Republic of the Congo.&nbsp; A quarter-century of experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990, and a democratically elected government took office in 1992, at which time the country reverted to "the Republic of the Congo" name. &nbsp;A two-year civil war that ended in 1999 restored to power former President Denis SASSOU-Nguesso, who had ruled from 1979 to 1992. A new constitution adopted three years later provided for a multi-party system and a seven-year presidential term, and the next elections retained SASSOU-Nguesso. After a year of renewed fighting, SASSOU-Nguesso and southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in 2003. SASSOU-Nguesso was reelected in 2009 and, after passing a constitutional referendum allowing him to run for additional terms, was reelected again in 2016 and 2021. The Republic of the Congo is one of Africa's largest petroleum producers.<br>

## Military and Security

**Military and security forces**<br>
Congolese Armed Forces (Forces Armees Congolaises, FAC): Army, Navy, Congolese Air Force, National Gendarmerie<br><br>Ministry of Interior: National Police (2025)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the National Gendarmerie (GN) is a paramilitary force with domestic law enforcement and security responsibilities; it is under the Ministry of Defense, but also reports to the Ministry of Interior; the GN nominally includes the Republican Guard (GR), which is responsible for presidential security and has a separate command structure<br>

**Military expenditures**<br>
1.2% of GDP (2024 est.)<br>
2% of GDP (2023 est.)<br>
1.8% of GDP (2022 est.)<br>
2.4% of GDP (2021 est.)<br>
2.8% of GDP (2020 est.)<br>

**Military and security service personnel strengths**<br>
approximately 12-14,000 active FAC, including Gendarmerie (2025)<br>

**Military equipment inventories and acquisitions**<br>
the FAC has mostly Soviet-era armaments, with a small mix of Chinese, French, and South African equipment (2024)<br>

**Military service age and obligation**<br>
18-25 years of age for voluntary military service for men and women; conscription ended in 1969 (2024)<br>

**Military deployments**<br>
has about 190 mostly police personnel deployed to the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) (2024)<br>

**Military - note**<br>
the FAC's primary focuses are internal and maritime security; since its creation in 1961, the FAC has had a turbulent history; it has been sidelined by some national leaders in favor of personal militias, endured an internal rebellion (1996), and clashed with various rebel groups and political or ethnic militias (1993-1996, 2002-2005, 2017); during the 1997-1999 civil war, the military generally split along ethnic lines, with most northern officers supporting eventual winner SASSOU-Nguesso, and most southerners backing the rebels; others joined ethnic-based factions loyal to regional warlords; forces backing SASSOU-Nguesso were supported by Angolan troops and received some French assistance; the FAC also has undergone at least three reorganizations that included the incorporation of former rebel combatants and various ethnic and political militias; in recent years, France has provided some advice and training, and a military cooperation agreement was signed with Russia in 2019 (2025)<br>

## Transnational Issues

**Refugees and internally displaced persons**<br>
_refugees (country of origin)_: 33,593 (Central African Republic), 29,785 (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (refugees and asylum seekers) (2024)<br>
_IDPs_: 27,000 (multiple civil wars since 1992) (2022)<br>

**Trafficking in persons**<br>
_tier rating_: Tier 2 Watch List — the government did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts to eliminate trafficking compared with the previous reporting period, therefore the Republic of the Congo remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year; for more details, go to:  https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-trafficking-in-persons-report/republic-of-the-congo/<br>
