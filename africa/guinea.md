# Guinea

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
<p>Guinea's deep Muslim heritage arrived via the neighboring Almoravid Empire in the 11th century. Following Almoravid decline, Guinea existed on the fringe of several African kingdoms, all competing for regional dominance. In the 13th century, the Mali Empire took control of Guinea, encouraging its already growing Muslim faith. After the fall of the West African empires, various smaller kingdoms controlled Guinea. In the 18th century, Fulani Muslims established an Islamic state in central Guinea that represents one of the earliest examples of a written constitution and alternating leadership. While European traders first arrived in the 16th century, it was the French who secured colonial rule in the 19th century.</p> <p>In 1958, Guinea achieved independence from France. Sekou TOURE became Guinea’s first post-independence president; he established a dictatorial regime and ruled until his death in 1984, after which General Lansana CONTE staged a coup and seized the government. He too established an authoritarian regime and manipulated presidential elections until his death in December 2008, when Captain Moussa Dadis CAMARA led a military coup, seized power, and suspended the constitution. In September 2009, presidential guards opened fire on an opposition rally, killing more than 150 people in Conakry, the capital. In early December 2009, CAMARA was wounded in an assassination attempt and exiled to Burkina Faso. In 2010 and 2013 respectively, the country held its first free and fair presidential and legislative elections. Alpha CONDE won the 2010 and 2015 presidential elections. CONDE's first cabinet was the first all-civilian government in Guinean history. In March 2020, Guinea passed a new constitution in a national referendum that changed presidential term limit rules. CONDE argued that, given this change, he was allowed to run for a third term, which he then won in October 2020. On 5 September 2021, Col Mamady DOUMBOUYA led special forces troops in a successful military coup, ousting and detaining CONDE and establishing the National Committee for Reconciliation and Development (CNRD). DOUMBOUYA and the CNRD suspended the constitution and dissolved the government and the legislature. DOUMBOUYA was sworn in as transition president on 1 October 2021, and appointed Mohamed BEAVOGUI as transition prime minister a week later. BEAVOGUI subsequently formed a largely technocratic cabinet. The National Transition Council (CNT), which acts as the legislative body for the transition, was formed on 22 January 2022. The 81-member CNT is led by Dr. Dansa KOUROUMA and consists of appointed members representing a broad swath of Guinean society.</p> <p> </p> <p><br><br></p><br>

## People and Society

**Population**<br>
13,607,249 (2023 est.)<br>

**Nationality**<br>
_noun_: Guinean(s)<br>
_adjective_: Guinean<br>

**Ethnic groups**<br>
Fulani (Peuhl) 33.4%, Malinke 29.4%, Susu 21.2%, Guerze 7.8%, Kissi 6.2%, Toma 1.6%, other/foreign 0.4% (2018 est.)<br>

Muslim 89.1%, Christian 6.8%, animist 1.6%, other 0.1%, none 2.4% (2014 est.)<br>

**Demographic profile**<br>
<p>Guinea’s strong population growth is a result of declining mortality rates and sustained elevated fertility. The population growth rate was somewhat tempered in the 2000s because of a period of net outmigration. Although life expectancy and mortality rates have improved over the last two decades, the nearly universal practice of female genital cutting continues to contribute to high infant and maternal mortality rates. Guinea’s total fertility remains high at about 5 children per woman as of 2022 because of the ongoing preference for larger families, low contraceptive usage and availability, a lack of educational attainment and empowerment among women, and poverty. A lack of literacy and vocational training programs limit job prospects for youths, but even those with university degrees often have no option but to work in the informal sector. About 60% of the country’s large youth population is unemployed.</p> <p>Tensions and refugees have spilled over Guinea’s borders with Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Cote d’Ivoire. During the 1990s Guinea harbored as many as half a million refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia, more refugees than any other African country for much of that decade. About half sought refuge in the volatile "Parrot’s Beak" region of southwest Guinea, a wedge of land jutting into Sierra Leone near the Liberian border. Many were relocated within Guinea in the early 2000s because the area suffered repeated cross-border attacks from various government and rebel forces, as well as anti-refugee violence.</p><br>

_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 105 (2020 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: the number of mobile subscribers grew strongly while revenue also increased steadily; fixed broadband services are still very limited and expensive, though there have been some positive developments in recent years; the landing of the first international submarine cable in 2012, and the setting up of an IXP in mid-2013, increased the bandwidth available to the ISPs, and helped reduce the cost of internet services for end-users; a National Backbone Network was completed in mid-2020, connecting administrative centers across the country; almost all internet connections are made via mobile networks; GSM services account for a dwindling proportion of connections, in line with the greater reach of services based on 3G and LTE (2022)<br>

## Military and Security

**Military and security forces**<br>
National Armed Forces: Army, Guinean Navy (Armee de Mer or Marine Guineenne), Guinean Air Force (Force Aerienne de Guinee), Presidential Security Battalion (Battailon Autonome de la Sécurité Presidentielle, BASP), Gendarmerie (2022)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the National Gendarmerie is overseen by the Ministry of Defense, while the National Police is under the Ministry of Security; the Gendarmerie and National Police share responsibility for internal security, but only the Gendarmerie can arrest police or military officials<br>

**Military expenditures**<br>
1.5% of GDP (2021 est.)<br>
1.4% of GDP (2020 est.)<br>
1.6% of GDP (2019 est.)<br>
1.8% of GDP (2018 est.)<br>
1.8% of GDP (2017 est.)<br>

**Military and security service personnel strengths**<br>
approximately 12,000 active personnel (9,000 Army; 400 Navy; 800 Air Force; 300 BASP; 1,500 Gendarmerie) (2022)<br>

**Military equipment inventories and acquisitions**<br>
the inventory of the Guinean military consists largely of aging and outdated (mostly Soviet-era) equipment; in recent years, it has received small amounts of equipment from China, France, Russia, and South Africa (2022)<br>

**Military service age and obligation**<br>
Voluntary and selective conscripted service, 9-24 mos (2022)<br>

**Military deployments**<br>
670 Mali (MINUSMA) (May 2022)<br>

**Military - note**<br>
the Guinean military is a small and lightly armed force that is responsible for external defense, but also has some domestic security responsibilities and has historically been involved in suppressing public protests; the military has undergone some attempts at reform since 2010, but in 2021 the Army&rsquo;s special forces led a successful coup; the Army has a mix of approximately 10 infantry, light armor, commando, and special forces battalions, as well as a presidential guard force; piracy and natural resource protection in the Gulf of Guinea are key areas of concern for the small Navy, which possesses only a few patrol boats; the Air Force has a handful of serviceable aircraft, including helicopter gunships (2023)<br>

**Maritime threats**<br>
the International Maritime Bureau reported no incidents in the territorial and offshore waters of Guinea in 2022; the offshore waters of the Niger Delta and Gulf of Guinea remain a very high risk for piracy and armed robbery of ships; past incidents have been reported where vessels were attacked and crews kidnapped; these incidents showed that the pirates / robbers in the area are well armed and violent; pirates have robbed vessels and kidnapped crews for ransom; in the past, product tankers were hijacked and cargo stolen; the Maritime Administration of the US Department of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2023-001 - Gulf of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 3 January 2023, which states in part, "Piracy, armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of Guinea"<br>

## Transnational Issues

**Disputes - international**<br>
<p>Sierra Leone considers Guinea's definition of the flood plain limits to define the left bank boundary of the Makona and Moa Rivers excessive and protests Guinea's continued occupation of these lands, including the hamlet of Yenga, occupied since 1998</p><br>

**Trafficking in persons**<br>
_tier rating_: Tier 2 Watch List &mdash; Guinea does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; the government&nbsp;initiated more investigations, identified and referred more victims to services, and issued an emergency anti-trafficking national action plan (NAP) to supplement the 2020-2022 NAP; officials established a hotline and allocated resources to the anti-trafficking committee; however, the government did not demonstrate overall increased efforts compared to the last year; substantial personnel turnover related to the September 2021 coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat hindered anti-trafficking efforts; no data was provided on prosecution of trafficking cases, and while more traffickers were convicted than previously, their sentences did not serve to deter the crime; fines in lieu of imprisonment for sex trafficking remain in the penal code; shelter services for victims remained insufficient, and NGO&rsquo;s providing victim services did not receive government support; Quranic teachers have not been prosecuted for allegedly forcing child begging; Guinea was granted a waiver per the TVPA from an otherwise required downgraded to Tier 3, therefore Guinea remained on the Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year (2022)<br>
_trafficking profile_: human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Guinea and Guineans abroad; Guinea is a source, transit, and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; vulnerable populations include adults and children working in the informal labor sector, homeless and orphaned children, artisanal miners, children and adults with albinism, and the mentally ill; Guinean women and girls are subjected to domestic servitude and commercial sexual exploitation, while boys are forced to beg, work as street vendors and shoe shiners, or work in mining, herding, fishing, and agriculture; North Koreans working in mining, construction, fishing, and health sectors and Cuban medical professionals working in Guinea may have been forced to work by their respective governments, while Chinese women are reportedly forced into prostitution in Guinea; Guinean women and girls have been exploited in domestic service and sex trafficking in West Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and the United States (2022)<br>
