# Liberia

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
<p>With 28 ethnic groups and languages, Liberia is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world. For hundreds of years, the Mali and Songhai Empires claimed most of Liberia. Beginning in the 15th century, European traders began establishing outposts along the Liberian coast. Unlike its neighbors, however, Liberia did not fall under European colonial rule. In the early 19th century, the US began sending freed enslaved people and other people of color to Liberia to establish settlements. In 1847, these settlers declared independence from the US, writing their own constitution and establishing Africa’s first republic.</p> <p>Early in Liberia’s history, tensions arose between the Americo-Liberian settlers and the indigenous population. In 1980, Samuel DOE, who was from the indigenous population, led a military coup and ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December 1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's regime that led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE was killed. A period of relative peace in 1997 permitted an election that brought TAYLOR to power. In 2000, fighting resumed. An August 2003 peace agreement ended the war and prompted President TAYLOR’s resignation. TAYLOR was later convicted by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague for his involvement in Sierra Leone's civil war. In late 2005, President Ellen JOHNSON SIRLEAF became president after two years of transitional governments; she was the first female head of state in Africa. In 2011, JOHNSON SIRLEAF won reelection but struggled to rebuild Liberia's economy, particularly following the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic, and to reconcile a nation still recovering from 14 years of fighting. In 2017, former soccer star George WEAH won the presidential runoff election, marking the first successful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another since the end of Liberia’s civil wars. Like his predecessor, WEAH has struggled to improve the country’s economy. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2023.</p> <p> </p><br>

## People and Society

**Population**<br>
5,506,280 (2023 est.)<br>

**Nationality**<br>
_noun_: Liberian(s)<br>
_adjective_: Liberian<br>

**Ethnic groups**<br>
Kpelle 20.3%, Bassa 13.4%, Grebo 10%, Gio 8%, Mano 7.9%, Kru 6%, Lorma 5.1%, Kissi 4.8%, Gola 4.4%, Krahn 4%, Vai 4%, Mandingo 3.2%, Gbandi 3%, Mende 1.3%, Sapo 1.3%, other Liberian 1.7%, other African 1.4%, non-African 0.1% (2008 est.)<br>

**Languages**<br>
English 20% (official), some 20 ethnic group languages few of which can be written or used in correspondence<br>

**Religions**<br>
Christian 85.6%, Muslim 12.2%, Traditional 0.6%, other 0.2%, none 1.5% (2008 est.)<br>

**Demographic profile**<br>
<p>Liberia’s high fertility rate of nearly 5 children per woman and large youth cohort – more than 60% of the population is under the age of 25 as of 2020 – will sustain a high dependency ratio for many years to come. Significant progress has been made in preventing child deaths, despite a lack of health care workers and infrastructure. Infant and child mortality have dropped nearly 70% since 1990; the annual reduction rate of about 5.4% is the highest in Africa.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Liberia’s high maternal mortality rate remains among the world’s worst; it reflects a high unmet need for family planning services, frequency of early childbearing, lack of quality obstetric care, high adolescent fertility, and a low proportion of births attended by a medical professional. Female mortality is also increased by the prevalence of female genital cutting (FGC), which is practiced by 10 of Liberia’s 16 tribes and affects more than two-thirds of women and girls. FGC is an initiation ritual performed in rural bush schools, which teach traditional beliefs on marriage and motherhood and are an obstacle to formal classroom education for Liberian girls.</p> <p>Liberia has been both a source and a destination for refugees. During Liberia’s 14-year civil war (1989-2003), more than 250,000 people became refugees and another half million were internally displaced. Between 2004 and the cessation of refugee status for Liberians in June 2012, the UNHCR helped more than 155,000 Liberians to voluntarily repatriate, while others returned home on their own. Some Liberian refugees spent more than two decades living in other West African countries. Between 2011 and 2022, more than 300,000 Ivoirian refugees in Liberia have been repatriated; as of year-end 2022, less than 2,300 Ivoirian refugees were still living in Liberia.</p><br>

## Communications

**Telephones - fixed lines**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 6,000 (2021 est.)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: (2021 est.) less than 1<br>

**Telephones - mobile cellular**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 1.7 million (2021 est.)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 32 (2021 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: Liberia has a telecom market which is mainly based on mobile networks; this is due to the civil war which destroyed much of the fixed-line infrastructure; to facilitate LTC Mobile&rsquo;s market entry, the government in January 2022 set in train amendments to telecom legislation; internet services are available from a number of wireless ISPs as well as the mobile operators; the high cost and limited bandwidth of connections means that internet access is expensive and rates are very low; additional bandwidth is available from an international submarine cable but considerable investment is still needed in domestic fixed-line infrastructure before end-users can make full use of the cable (2022)<br>
_domestic_: fixed-line less than 1 per 100; mobile-cellular subscriptions are 32 per 100 persons (2021)<br>
_international_: country code - 231; landing point for the ACE submarine cable&nbsp;linking 20 West&nbsp;African countries and Europe;&nbsp;satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br>

**Broadcast media**<br>
8 private and 1 government-owned TV station; satellite TV service available; 1 state-owned radio station; approximately&nbsp;20 independent radio stations broadcasting in Monrovia, with approximately&nbsp;80 more local stations operating in other areas; transmissions of 4 international (including the British Broadcasting Corporation and Radio France Internationale) broadcasters are available (2019)<br>

## Transportation

**Civil aircraft registration country code prefix**<br>
A8<br>

**Airports**<br>
29 (2021)<br>

**Airports - with paved runways**<br>
2<br>
<strong>note:</strong> paved runways have a concrete or asphalt surface but not all have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control; the length of a runway required for aircraft to safely operate depends on a number of factors including the type of aircraft, the takeoff weight (including passengers, cargo, and fuel), engine types, flap settings, landing speed, elevation of the airport, and average maximum daily air temperature; paved runways can reach a length of 5,000 m (16,000 ft.), but the “typical” length of a commercial airline runway is between 2,500-4,000 m (8,000-13,000 ft.)<br>

**Airports - with unpaved runways**<br>
27<br>
<strong>note:</strong> unpaved runways have a surface composition such as grass or packed earth and are most suited to the operation of light aircraft; unpaved runways are usually short, often less than 1,000 m (3,280 ft.) in length; airports with unpaved runways often lack facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control<br>

**Pipelines**<br>
4 km oil (2013)<br>

**Railways**<br>
_total_: 429 km (2008)<br>
_standard gauge_: 345 km (2008) 1.435-m gauge<br>
_narrow gauge_: 84 km (2008) 1.067-m gauge<br>
<strong>note:</strong> most sections of the railways inoperable due to damage sustained during the civil wars from 1980 to 2003, but many are being rebuilt<br>

**Roadways**<br>
_total_: 10,600 km (2018)<br>
_paved_: 657 km (2018)<br>
_unpaved_: 9,943 km (2018)<br>

**Merchant marine**<br>
_total_: 4,311 (2022)<br>
_by type_: bulk carrier 1,673, container ship 962, general cargo 141, oil tanker 907, other 628<br>

0.5% of GDP (2020 est.)<br>
0.6% of GDP (2019 est.)<br>
0.5% of GDP (2018 est.)<br>

**Military and security service personnel strengths**<br>
approximately 2,000 active personnel (2023)<br>

**Military equipment inventories and acquisitions**<br>
the military has a limited inventory; in recent years, it has received small quantities of equipment, including donations, from countries such as China and the US (2023)<br>

**Military service age and obligation**<br>
18-35 years of age for men and women for voluntary military service; no conscription (2023)<br>

**Military deployments**<br>
160 Mali (MINUSMA) (2023)<br>

**Military - note**<br>
the AFL is responsible for external defense but also has some domestic security responsibilities if called upon, such as humanitarian assistance during natural disasters and support to law enforcement; it is a small, lightly equipped force comprised of 2 combat infantry battalions and supporting units; the infantry battalions were rebuilt with US assistance in 2007-2008 from the restructured AFL following the end of the second civil war in 2003 when military and police forces were disbanded and approximately 100,000 military, police, and rebel combatants were disarmed<br><br>the first militia unit established for defense of the colony was raised in 1832; the AFL traces its origins to the 1908 establishment of the Liberia Frontier Force, which became the Liberian National Guard in 1965; the AFL was established in 1970<br><br>the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) was established in 2003 as a peacekeeping force; at its height, UNMIL was comprised of about 15,000 personnel, including more than 3,000 troops absorbed from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) peacekeeping mission; Liberian forces reassumed full control of the country’s security in June of 2016, and the UNMIL mission was ended in 2018 (2023)<br>

## Transnational Issues

**Disputes - international**<br>
<p><em>Liberia-Guinea</em>: none identified</p> <p><em>Liberia-Sierra Leone</em>: none identified</p><br>

**Illicit drugs**<br>
<p>not a significant transit country for illicit narcotics bound for the United States or Europe; not a key producer of illicit drugs; proximity to major drug transit routes contribute to trafficking cocaine and heroin, to and through Liberia and other West African countries; local drug use involves locally grown cannabis, heroin (mostly smoked), cocaine (snorted), and more recently kush (Cannabis Indic’s type flower), mixed with different substances including heroin or synthetic DMT</p><br>
