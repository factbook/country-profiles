# Namibia

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Various ethnic groups occupied southwestern Africa prior to Germany establishing a colony over most of the territory in 1884. South Africa occupied the colony, then known as German South West Africa, in 1915 during World War I and administered it as a mandate until after World War II, when it annexed the territory. In 1966, the Marxist South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrilla group launched a war of independence for the area that became Namibia, but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its administration in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region. Namibia gained independence in 1990, and SWAPO has governed it since, although the party has dropped much of its Marxist ideology. President Hage GEINGOB was elected in 2014 in a landslide victory, replacing Hifikepunye POHAMBA, who stepped down after serving two terms. SWAPO retained its parliamentary super majority in the 2014 elections. In 2019 elections, GEINGOB was reelected but by a substantially reduced majority, and SWAPO narrowly lost its super majority in parliament.<br>

**Demographic profile**<br>
<p>Planning officials view Namibia’s reduced population growth rate as sustainable based on the country’s economic growth over the past decade. Prior to independence in 1990, Namibia’s relatively small population grew at about 3% annually, but declining fertility and the impact of HIV/AIDS slowed this growth to 1.4% by 2011, rebounding to close to 2% by 2016. Namibia’s fertility rate has fallen over the last two decades – from about 4.5 children per woman in 1996 to 3.4 in 2016 and to 3 in 2022 – due to increased contraceptive use, higher educational attainment among women, and greater female participation in the labor force. The average age at first birth has stayed fairly constant, but the age at first marriage continues to increase, indicating a rising incidence of premarital childbearing.</p> <p>The majority of Namibians are rural dwellers (about 55%) and live in the better-watered north and northeast parts of the country. Migration, historically male-dominated, generally flows from northern communal areas – non-agricultural lands where blacks were sequestered under the apartheid system – to agricultural, mining, and manufacturing centers in the center and south. After independence from South Africa, restrictions on internal movement eased, and rural-urban migration increased, bolstering urban growth.</p> <p>Some Namibians – usually persons who are better-educated, more affluent, and from urban areas – continue to legally migrate to South Africa temporarily to visit family and friends and, much less frequently, to pursue tertiary education or better economic opportunities. Namibians concentrated along the country’s other borders make unauthorized visits to Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, or Botswana, to visit family and to trade agricultural goods. Few Namibians express interest in permanently settling in other countries; they prefer the safety of their homeland, have a strong national identity, and enjoy a well-supplied retail sector. Although Namibia is receptive to foreign investment and cross-border trade, intolerance toward non-citizens is widespread.</p><br>

_total subscriptions_: 2.906 million (2022 est.)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 113 (2022 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: the government&rsquo;s Broadband Policy aims to provide 95% population coverage by 2024; mobile network coverage has increased sharply in recent years; by 2023, 3G infrastructure provided 89% population coverage while LTE infrastructure provided 79% coverage; despite the relatively advanced nature of the market, progress towards 5G has been slow, partly due to unsubstantiated public concerns over health implications of the technology which caused the government to order an environmental assessment of 5G in mid-2020; the government has requested the regulator to speed up its 5G development strategy; Namibia&rsquo;s internet and broadband sector is reasonably competitive, its development was for many years held back by high prices for international bandwidth caused by the lack of a direct connection to international submarine cables; this market situation improved after operators invested in diversifying terrestrial access routes to adjacent countries; in June 2022 Namibia was connected to a 1,050km branch line of cable running between Portugal and South Africa (2022)<br>
_domestic_: fixed-line subscribership is 4 per 100 and mobile-cellular roughly 113 per 100 persons (2022) (2021)<br>
_international_: country code - 264;&nbsp;landing points for the ACE and WACS&nbsp;fiber-optic submarine cable linking southern and western African countries to Europe; satellite earth stations - 4 Intelsat (2019)<br>

**Broadcast media**<br>

## Military and Security

**Military and security forces**<br>
Namibian Defense Force (NDF): Army, Navy, Air Force (2024)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the Namibian Police Force is under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Immigration, Safety, and Security; it has a paramilitary Special Field Force responsible for protecting borders and government installations<br>

**Military expenditures**<br>
3% of GDP (2022 est.)<br>
3% of GDP (2021 est.)<br>
3.4% of GDP (2020 est.)<br>
3.3% of GDP (2019 est.)<br>
3.4% of GDP (2018 est.)<br>

**Military and security service personnel strengths**<br>
information varies; approximately 12,500 personnel (11,000 Army; 1,000 Navy; 500 Air Force) (2023)<br>

**Military equipment inventories and acquisitions**<br>
the NDF's inventory consists of a mix of Soviet-era and some more modern systems from a variety of countries, including Brazil, China, Germany, India, and South Africa; in recent years, China has been the leading supplier; Namibia has a small defense industry that produces items such as armored personnel carriers (2023)<br>

**Military service age and obligation**<br>
18-25 years of age for men and women for voluntary military service; no conscription (2023)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> as of 2018, women comprised more than 20% of the active duty military<br>

**Military - note**<br>
the NDF’s primary responsibility is external security; it has participated in UN and regional peacekeeping and security missions and provides assistance to civil authorities as needed; it participates in multinational training exercises; the Army fields a largely mobile force centered on three small motorized infantry brigades and a reconnaissance regiment; the Navy has a Chinese-built multipurpose offshore patrol ship equipped with a helicopter landing platform and supported by several coastal patrol vessels, while the Air Force has a small inventory of aircraft, including a few Chinese-made fighters and Soviet-era attack helicopters <br><br>the NDF was created in 1990, largely from demobilized former members of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and the South West Africa Territorial Force (SWATF); PLAN was the armed wing of the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO), while SWATF was an auxiliary of the South African Defense Force and comprised the armed forces of the former South West Africa, 1977-1989; from 1990-1995, the British military assisted with the forming and training the NDF (2023)<br>
