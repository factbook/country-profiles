# Cook Islands

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Polynesians from Tahiti were probably the first people to settle Rarotonga around A.D. 900. Over time, Samoans and Tongans also settled in Rarotonga, and Rarotongans voyaged to the northern Cook Islands, settling Manihiki and Rakahanga. Pukapuka and Penrhyn in the northern Cook Islands were settled directly from Samoa. Prior to European contact, there was considerable travel and trade between inhabitants of the different islands and atolls but they were not united in a single political entity. Spanish navigators were the first Europeans to spot the northern Cook Islands in 1595 followed by the first landing in 1606. The Cook Islands remained free of further European contact until the 1760s, and in 1773, British explorer James COOK saw Manuae in the southern Cook Islands. The islands were named after COOK in the 1820s by Russian mapmakers. English missionary activity during the 1820s and 1830s banned singing and dancing and converted most of the population.<br><br>Fearing France would militarily occupy the islands like it did in Tahiti, Rarotongans asked the UK for protectorate status in the 1840s and 1860s, which the UK ignored. In 1888, Queen MAKEA TAKAU of Rarotonga formally petitioned for protectorate status, which the UK reluctantly agreed to. In 1901, the UK placed Rarotonga and the rest of the islands in the New Zealand Colony and in 1915, the Cook Islands Act organized the Cook Islands into one political entity. It remained a protectorate until 1965, when New Zealand granted the Cook Islands self-government status. The Cook Islands has a great deal of local autonomy and is an independent member of international organizations, but it is in free association with New Zealand, which is responsible for defense and foreign affairs. Economic opportunities in the Cook Islands are sparse, and more Cook Islanders live in New Zealand than in the Cook Islands.<br><br>In a referendum in 1994, voters chose to keep the name Cook Islands rather than changing to a Maori name for the islands. The issue was revived in 2019, but after being poorly received by the diaspora in New Zealand, the government decided to retain the name Cook Islands but to provide a Maori name alongside it. The Maori name has not yet been determined.<br>

## Communications

**Telephones - fixed lines**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 7,000 (2021 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: demand for mobile broadband is increasing due to mobile services being the primary and most wide-spread source for Internet access across the region; Telecom Cook Islands offers international direct dialing, Internet, email, and fax; individual islands are connected by a combination of satellite earth stations, microwave systems, and VHF and HF radiotelephone (2020)<br>
_domestic_: service is provided by small exchanges connected to subscribers by open-wire, cable, and fiber-optic cable; nearly 41 per 100 fixed-line and about 100 per 100 mobile-cellular (2021)<br>
_international_: country code - 682; the Manatua submarine cable to surrounding islands of Niue,&nbsp;Samoa,&nbsp;French Polynesia and other Cook Islands, the&nbsp;topography of the South Pacific region has made Internet connectivity a serious&nbsp;issue for many of the remote islands; submarine fiber-optic networks are expensive to build and maintain;&nbsp;satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2019)<br>

**Broadcast media**<br>
1 privately owned TV station broadcasts from Rarotonga providing a mix of local news and overseas-sourced programs (2019)<br>

## Transportation

**National air transport system**<br>
_number of registered air carriers_: 1 (2020)<br>
_inventory of registered aircraft operated by air carriers_: 6<br>

**Civil aircraft registration country code prefix**<br>
E5<br>

**Airports**<br>
11 (2021)<br>

**Airports - with paved runways**<br>
1<br>
<strong>note:</strong> paved runways have a concrete or asphalt surface but not all have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control; the length of a runway required for aircraft to safely operate depends on a number of factors including the type of aircraft, the takeoff weight (including passengers, cargo, and fuel), engine types, flap settings, landing speed, elevation of the airport, and average maximum daily air temperature; paved runways can reach a length of 5,000 m (16,000 ft.), but the “typical” length of a commercial airline runway is between 2,500-4,000 m (8,000-13,000 ft.)<br>

**Airports - with unpaved runways**<br>
10<br>
<strong>note:</strong> unpaved runways have a surface composition such as grass or packed earth and are most suited to the operation of light aircraft; unpaved runways are usually short, often less than 1,000 m (3,280 ft.) in length; airports with unpaved runways often lack facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control<br>

**Roadways**<br>
_total_: 295 km (2018)<br>
_paved_: 207 km (2018)<br>
_unpaved_: 88 km (2018)<br>
