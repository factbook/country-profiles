# Vanuatu

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Multiple waves of colonizers, each speaking a distinct language, migrated to the New Hebrides in the millennia preceding European exploration in the 18th century. This settlement pattern accounts for the complex linguistic diversity found on the archipelago to this day. The British and French, who settled the New Hebrides in the 19th century, agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French Condominium, which administered the islands until independence in 1980, when the new name of Vanuatu was adopted. Politics and society continue to be divided along linguistic lines, although those divisions are lessening over time. Coalition governments tend to be weak, and since 2008, prime ministers have been ousted through no-confidence motions or temporary procedural issues 10 times. Prime Minister Charlot SALAWI has survived at least five no-confidence motions since taking office in 2016.<br>

## Economy

**Economic overview**<br>
<p>This South Pacific island economy is based primarily on small-scale agriculture, which provides a living for about two thirds of the population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with more than 330,000 visitors in 2017, are other mainstays of the economy. Tourism has struggled after Efate, the most populous and most popular island for tourists, was damaged by Tropical Cyclone Pam in 2015. Ongoing infrastructure difficulties at Port Vila’s Bauerfield Airport have caused air travel disruptions, further hampering tourism numbers. Australia and New Zealand are the main source of tourists and foreign aid. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits.</p><p></p><p>Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands. In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center.</p><p></p><p>Since 2002, the government has stepped up efforts to boost tourism through improved air connections, resort development, and cruise ship facilities. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, is a second target for growth.</p><br>

## Communications

**Telephones - fixed lines**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 3,809<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 1.3 (2019 est.)<br>

**Telephones - mobile cellular**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 265,219<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 90.56 (2019 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: <p>liberalized telecom services; mobile phones are primary means of communication; LTE services and rural satellite broadband services; mobile phone use in some rural areas is constrained by electricity shortages; investment in fixed-broadband infrastructure and installation of fiber-optic cables supported sector growth; mobile broadband infrastructure expanded in 2020, resulting in reduced consumer prices; Kacific-1 broadband satellite has improved broadband capacity and access since 2019; importer of broadcasting equipment from China (2021)</p> (2020)<br>
_domestic_: fixed-line 1 per 100 and mobile-cellular 88 per 100 (2019)<br>
_international_: country code - 678; landing points for the ICN1 &amp; ICN2 submarine cables providing connectivity to the Solomon Islands and Fiji; cables helped end-users with Internet bandwidth; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean) (2020)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced downturn, particularly in mobile device production; many network operators delayed upgrades to infrastructure; progress towards 5G implementation was postponed or slowed in some countries; consumer spending on telecom services and devices was affected by large-scale job losses and the consequent restriction on disposable incomes; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home became evident, and received some support from governments<br>
