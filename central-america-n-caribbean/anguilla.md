_Central America and Caribbean / Dependencies (United Kingdom)_

# Anguilla

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650, Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century, when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint Kitts and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this arrangement was formally recognized in 1980, with Anguilla becoming a separate British dependency. On 7 September 2017, the island suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Irma, particularly to communications and residential and business infrastructure.<br>

_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 38 (2021 est.)<br>

**Telephones - mobile cellular**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 26,000 (2021 est.)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 170 (2021 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: in the telecom sector, with declines seen in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid mobile services &mdash; the mainstay of short-term visitors) and revenue; fixed and mobile broadband services are two areas that have benefited from the crisis to a small extent as employees and students have resorted to working from home, but their contribution to the sector has been insufficient to offset steep falls in other areas of the market; one area of the telecom market that does not yet appear poised for growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators, and even the mobile network operators have shown that they have little appetite for investing in 5G opportunities at the present time; network expansion and enhancements remain concentrated around improving LTE coverage; until the economies and markets stabilize, and overseas visitors return there is unlikely to be much momentum towards implementing 5G capabilities anywhere in the region (2021)<br>
_domestic_: fixed-line teledensity is about 38 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular teledensity is roughly 170 per 100 persons (2021)<br>
_international_: country code - 1-264; landing points for the&nbsp;SSCS, ECFS, GCN&nbsp;and Southern Caribbean Fiber with submarine cable&nbsp;links to&nbsp;Caribbean islands&nbsp;and to the US; microwave radio relay to island of Saint Martin/Sint Maarten (2019)<br>

**Airports - with paved runways**<br>
1<br>
<strong>note:</strong> paved runways have a concrete or asphalt surface but not all have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control; the length of a runway required for aircraft to safely operate depends on a number of factors including the type of aircraft, the takeoff weight (including passengers, cargo, and fuel), engine types, flap settings, landing speed, elevation of the airport, and average maximum daily air temperature; paved runways can reach a length of 5,000 m (16,000 ft.), but the “typical” length of a commercial airline runway is between 2,500-4,000 m (8,000-13,000 ft.)<br>

_paved_: 82 km (2004)<br>
