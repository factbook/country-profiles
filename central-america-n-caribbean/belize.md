# Belize

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1862. Territorial disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border dispute. Both nations have voted to send the dispute for final resolution to the International Court of Justice. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy. Current concerns include the country's heavy foreign debt burden, high crime rates, high unemployment combined with a majority youth population, growing involvement in the Mexican and South American drug trade, and one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in Central America.<br>

## People and Society

**Population**<br>
412,387 (2022 est.)<br>

**Nationality**<br>
_noun_: Belizean(s)<br>
_adjective_: Belizean<br>

**Ethnic groups**<br>
Mestizo 52.9%, Creole 25.9%, Maya 11.3%, Garifuna 6.1%, East Indian 3.9%, Mennonite 3.6%, White 1.2%, Asian 1%, other 1.2%, unknown 0.3% (2010 est.)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> percentages add up to more than 100% because respondents were able to identify more than one ethnic origin<br>

**Languages**<br>
English 62.9% (official), Spanish 56.6%, Creole 44.6%, Maya 10.5%, German 3.2%, Garifuna 2.9%, other 1.8%, unknown 0.5%; note - shares sum to more than 100% because some respondents gave more than one answer on the census (2010 est.)<br>
_major-language sample(s)_: <br>The World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information. (English)<br><br>La Libreta Informativa del Mundo, la fuente indispensable de información básica. (Spanish)<br>

**Religions**<br>
Roman Catholic 40.1%, Protestant 31.5% (includes Pentecostal 8.4%, Seventh Day Adventist 5.4%, Anglican 4.7%, Mennonite 3.7%, Baptist 3.6%, Methodist 2.9%, Nazarene 2.8%), Jehovah's Witness 1.7%, other 10.5% (includes Baha'i, Buddhist, Hindu, Church of Jesus Christ, Muslim, Rastafarian, Salvation Army), unspecified 0.6%, none 15.5% (2010 est.)<br>

**Demographic profile**<br>
<p>Migration continues to transform Belize's population. About 16% of Belizeans live abroad, while immigrants constitute approximately 15% of Belize's population. Belizeans seeking job and educational opportunities have preferred to emigrate to the United States rather than former colonizer Great Britain because of the United States' closer proximity and stronger trade ties with Belize. Belizeans also emigrate to Canada, Mexico, and English-speaking Caribbean countries. The emigration of a large share of Creoles (Afro-Belizeans) and the influx of Central American immigrants, mainly Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans, has changed Belize's ethnic composition. Mestizos have become the largest ethnic group, and Belize now has more native Spanish speakers than English or Creole speakers, despite English being the official language. In addition, Central American immigrants are establishing new communities in rural areas, which contrasts with the urbanization trend seen in neighboring countries. Recently, Chinese, European, and North American immigrants have become more frequent.</p><p>Immigration accounts for an increasing share of Belize's population growth rate, which is steadily falling due to fertility decline. Belize's declining birth rate and its increased life expectancy are creating an aging population. As the elderly population grows and nuclear families replace extended households, Belize's government will be challenged to balance a rising demand for pensions, social services, and healthcare for its senior citizens with the need to reduce poverty and social inequality and to improve sanitation.</p><br>

## Economy

**Economic overview**<br>
<p>Tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner in this small economy, followed by exports of sugar, bananas, citrus, marine products, and crude oil.</p> <p> </p> <p>The government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in September 1998, led to GDP growth averaging nearly 4% in 1999-2007, but GPD growth has averaged only 2.1% from 2007-2016, with 2.5% growth estimated for 2017. Belize’s dependence on energy imports makes it susceptible to energy price shocks.</p> <p> </p> <p>Although Belize has the third highest per capita income in Central America, the average income figure masks a huge income disparity between rich and poor, and a key government objective remains reducing poverty and inequality with the help of international donors. High unemployment, a growing trade deficit and heavy foreign debt burden continue to be major concerns. Belize faces continued pressure from rising sovereign debt, and a growing trade imbalance.</p><br>

## Communications

**Telephones - fixed lines**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 19,000 (2020 est.)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 5 (2020 est.)<br>

**Telephones - mobile cellular**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 264,000 (2020 est.)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 66 (2020 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: Belize&rsquo;s fixed-line teledensity and mobile subscriptions remain lower than average for the region, a legacy of insufficient market competition and low investment in telecoms services, exacerbated by lax managerial standards within the incumbent telco Digi; Digi has undertaken significant investment in infrastructure, launching an LTE-A service at the end of 2016 and in mid-2017 completing a submarine cable to Ambergris Caye, enabling it to launch an FttP service in San Pedro; loans secured since 2017 enabled the company to migrate its infrastructure from legacy copper to fiber; BTL invested BZ$93 million dollars to provide high speed broadband to 80% of residences across Belize; the telecom market was liberalized in 2003 yet Digi continues to hold a monopoly in fixed-line services, and it remains the dominant provider of mobile and broadband services; the government has undertaken some measures to improve competition, notably by obliging Digi in mid-2013 to open its networks to VoIP services. (2021)<br>
_domestic_: roughly 5 per 100 fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity of 65 per 100 persons; mobile sector accounting for over 90% of all phone subscriptions (2019)<br>
_international_: country code - 501; landing points for the&nbsp;ARCOS and SEUL&nbsp;fiber-optic telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to South and Central America, parts of the Caribbean, and the US; satellite earth station - 8 (Intelsat - 2, unknown - 6) (2019)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress towards 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services<br>

## Military and Security

**Military and security forces**<br>
Belize Defense Force (BDF): Army, Air Wing; Belize Coast Guard (2022)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the Ministry of National Defense and Border Security is responsible for oversight of the BDF and the Coast Guard, while the Ministry of Home Affairs and New Growth Industries has responsibility for police and prisons<br>

**Military expenditures**<br>
1.3% of GDP (2021 est.)<br>
1.5% of GDP (2020 est.)<br>
1.4% of GDP (2019 est.) (approximately $35 million)<br>
1.4% of GDP (2018 est.) (approximately $35 million)<br>
1.4% of GDP (2017 est.) (approximately $30 million)<br>

**Military and security service personnel strengths**<br>
approximately 1,300 BDF personnel; approximately 300 Belize Coast Guard (2022)<br>

**Military equipment inventories and acquisitions**<br>
the BDF's inventory is limited and consists mostly of UK- and US-origin equipment (2022)<br>

**Military service age and obligation**<br>
18 years of age for voluntary military service; laws allow for conscription only if volunteers are insufficient, but conscription has never been implemented; volunteers typically outnumber available positions by 3:1; initial service obligation 12 years (2022)<br>

**Military - note**<br>
<p>the BDF was established in 1978 from the disbanded Police Special Force and the Belize Volunteer Guard to assist the resident British forces with the defense of Belize against Guatemala; the BDF traces its history back to the Prince Regent Royal Honduras Militia, a volunteer force established in 1817</p> <p>the British Army has maintained a presence in Belize since its independence; as of 2022, the presence consisted of a small training support unit that provides jungle training to troops from the UK and international partners</p><br>

## Transnational Issues

**Disputes - international**<br>
<p><em>Belize-Guatemala: </em>Demarcated but insecure boundary due to Guatemala’s claims to more than half of Belizean territory.  Line of Adjacency operates in lieu of an international boundary to control influx of Guatemalan squatters onto Belizean territory. Smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and human trafficking for sexual exploitation and debt bondage are all problems. Belize lacks resources to detect and extradite impoverished Guatemalan peasants squatting in Belizean rain forests in the remote border areas. </p> <p><em>Belize-Mexico:</em> Belize and Mexico are working to solve minor border demarcation discrepancies arising from inaccuracies in the 1898 border treaty. Transshipment of illegal<strong> </strong>narcotics, smuggling, human trafficking, illegal immigration, and the growing of marijuana in very low population areas are all issues in the region today.</p><br>

**Trafficking in persons**<br>
_current situation_: human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims and Belizeans abroad; Belizean and foreign women, men, and girls and LGBTI persons, mainly from Central America, are sex trafficked in bars, nightclubs, hotels, and brothels; men, women, and children from Central America, Mexico, and Asia may migrate voluntarily to Belize seeking work and then are subjected to forced labor in restaurants, shops, domestic work, and agriculture; foreign child sex tourists exploit children in tourist areas<br>
_tier rating_: Tier 2 Watch List &mdash; Belize does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; authorities initiated more trafficking investigations, convicted a trafficker, screened for potential trafficking victims during labor inspections, and continued to implement a 2018-2020 national anti-trafficking action plan; anti-trafficking training was provided to the anti-trafficking police unit, immigration officers, prosecutors, judges, prison officials, and social workers; however, the government did not initiate any new trafficking prosecutions and continued to apply victim identification procedures inconsistently; corruption and official complicity in trafficking remained concerns, but no investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees were reported (2020)<br>

**Illicit drugs**<br>
<p>Belize is a transit country for illegal drugs, mainly cocaine, originating from countries in South America; low domestic drug consumption problem outside of recreational cannabis</p><br>
