# Belize

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1862. Territorial disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border dispute. Both nations have voted to send the dispute for final resolution to the International Court of Justice. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy. Current concerns include the country's heavy foreign debt burden, high crime rates, high unemployment combined with a majority youth population, growing involvement in the Mexican and South American drug trade, and one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in Central America.<br>

## People and Society

**Population**<br>
419,137 (2023 est.)<br>

**Nationality**<br>
_noun_: Belizean(s)<br>
_adjective_: Belizean<br>

**Ethnic groups**<br>
Mestizo 52.9%, Creole 25.9%, Maya 11.3%, Garifuna 6.1%, East Indian 3.9%, Mennonite 3.6%, White 1.2%, Asian 1%, other 1.2%, unknown 0.3% (2010 est.)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> percentages add up to more than 100% because respondents were able to identify more than one ethnic origin<br>

**Languages**<br>
English 62.9% (official), Spanish 56.6%, Creole 44.6%, Maya 10.5%, German 3.2%, Garifuna 2.9%, other 1.8%, unknown 0.5%; note - shares sum to more than 100% because some respondents gave more than one answer on the census (2010 est.)<br>
_major-language sample(s)_: <br>The World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information. (English)<br><br>La Libreta Informativa del Mundo, la fuente indispensable de información básica. (Spanish)<br>

**Religions**<br>
Roman Catholic 40.1%, Protestant 31.5% (includes Pentecostal 8.4%, Seventh Day Adventist 5.4%, Anglican 4.7%, Mennonite 3.7%, Baptist 3.6%, Methodist 2.9%, Nazarene 2.8%), Jehovah's Witness 1.7%, other 10.5% (includes Baha'i, Buddhist, Hindu, Church of Jesus Christ, Muslim, Rastafarian, Salvation Army), unspecified 0.6%, none 15.5% (2010 est.)<br>

**Demographic profile**<br>
<p>Migration continues to transform Belize's population. About 16% of Belizeans live abroad, while immigrants constitute approximately 15% of Belize's population. Belizeans seeking job and educational opportunities have preferred to emigrate to the United States rather than former colonizer Great Britain because of the United States' closer proximity and stronger trade ties with Belize. Belizeans also emigrate to Canada, Mexico, and English-speaking Caribbean countries. The emigration of a large share of Creoles (Afro-Belizeans) and the influx of Central American immigrants, mainly Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans, has changed Belize's ethnic composition. Mestizos have become the largest ethnic group, and Belize now has more native Spanish speakers than English or Creole speakers, despite English being the official language. In addition, Central American immigrants are establishing new communities in rural areas, which contrasts with the urbanization trend seen in neighboring countries. Recently, Chinese, European, and North American immigrants have become more frequent.</p><p>Immigration accounts for an increasing share of Belize's population growth rate, which is steadily falling due to fertility decline. Belize's declining birth rate and its increased life expectancy are creating an aging population. As the elderly population grows and nuclear families replace extended households, Belize's government will be challenged to balance a rising demand for pensions, social services, and healthcare for its senior citizens with the need to reduce poverty and social inequality and to improve sanitation.</p><br>

_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 66 (2021 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: Belize&rsquo;s fixed-line teledensity and mobile penetration remain lower than average for the region, a legacy of insufficient market competition and under investment in telecoms services; a significant investment in infrastructure, launching an LTE-A service at the end of 2016 and in mid-2017 completing a submarine cable to Ambergris Caye, enabling it to launch an FttP service in San Pedro; the nfrastructure has been updated from the legacy copper to fiber; investments have been made to provide high speed broadband to 80% of residences across Belize. (2021)<br>
_domestic_: roughly 5 per 100 fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity of 66 per 100 persons; mobile sector accounting for over 90% of all phone subscriptions (2021)<br>
_international_: country code - 501; landing points for the&nbsp;ARCOS and SEUL&nbsp;fiber-optic telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to South and Central America, parts of the Caribbean, and the US; satellite earth station - 8 (Intelsat - 2, unknown - 6) (2019)<br>

**Airports**<br>
47 (2021)<br>

**Airports - with paved runways**<br>
6<br>
<strong>note:</strong> paved runways have a concrete or asphalt surface but not all have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control; the length of a runway required for aircraft to safely operate depends on a number of factors including the type of aircraft, the takeoff weight (including passengers, cargo, and fuel), engine types, flap settings, landing speed, elevation of the airport, and average maximum daily air temperature; paved runways can reach a length of 5,000 m (16,000 ft.), but the “typical” length of a commercial airline runway is between 2,500-4,000 m (8,000-13,000 ft.)<br>

**Airports - with unpaved runways**<br>
41<br>
<strong>note:</strong> unpaved runways have a surface composition such as grass or packed earth and are most suited to the operation of light aircraft; unpaved runways are usually short, often less than 1,000 m (3,280 ft.) in length; airports with unpaved runways often lack facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control<br>

**Roadways**<br>
_total_: 3,281 km (2017)<br>
_paved_: 601 km (2017)<br>
_unpaved_: 2,680 km (2017)<br>

**Waterways**<br>

## Military and Security

**Military and security forces**<br>
Belize Defense Force (BDF): Army, Air Wing; Belize Coast Guard; Belize Police Department (2023)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the Ministry of National Defense and Border Security is responsible for oversight of the BDF and the Coast Guard, while the Ministry of Home Affairs and New Growth Industries has responsibility for the Belize Police Department and prisons; the Police Department is primarily responsible for internal security <br>

**Military expenditures**<br>
1.1% of GDP (2022 est.)<br>
1.3% of GDP (2021 est.)<br>
1.5% of GDP (2020 est.)<br>
1.4% of GDP (2019 est.)<br>
1.4% of GDP (2018 est.)<br>

**Military and security service personnel strengths**<br>
approximately 1,500 BDF personnel; approximately 500 Coast Guard (2023)<br>

**Military equipment inventories and acquisitions**<br>
the military has a small inventory consisting mostly of UK- and US-origin equipment (2023)<br>

**Military service age and obligation**<br>
18 years of age for voluntary military service; laws allow for conscription only if volunteers are insufficient, but conscription has never been implemented; initial service obligation is 12 years (2023)<br>

**Military - note**<br>
the Belize Defense Force (BDF) is responsible for external security but also provides some support to civilian authorities; it has limited powers of arrest within land and shoreline areas, while the Coast Guard has arrest powers and jurisdiction within coastal and maritime areas; the BDF traces its history back to the Prince Regent Royal Honduras Militia, a volunteer force established in 1817; the BDF was established in 1978 from the disbanded Police Special Force and the Belize Volunteer Guard to assist the resident British forces with the defense of Belize against Guatemala<br><br>the British Army has maintained a presence in Belize since its independence; the presence consists of a small training support unit that provides jungle training to troops from the UK and international partners (2023)<br>

## Transnational Issues

**Disputes - international**<br>
<p><em>Belize-Guatemala: </em>demarcated but insecure boundary due to Guatemala’s claims to more than half of Belizean territory; a Line of Adjacency operates in lieu of an international boundary to control influx of Guatemalan squatters onto Belizean territory, as well as smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and human trafficking for sexual exploitation and debt bondage; Belize and Honduras 12-nm territorial sea claims close off Guatemalan access to Caribbean in the Bahia de Amatique; maritime boundary remains unresolved pending further negotiation<br><br><em>Belize-Honduras:</em> Honduras claims the Belizean-administered Sapodilla Cays off the coast of Belize in its constitution, but agreed to a joint ecological park around the cays should Guatemala consent to a maritime corridor in the Caribbean under the OAS-sponsored 2002 Belize-Guatemala Differendum</p> <p><em>Belize-Mexico:</em> Belize and Mexico are working to solve minor border demarcation discrepancies arising from inaccuracies in the 1898 border treaty; transshipment of illegal<strong> </strong>narcotics, smuggling, human trafficking, illegal immigration, and the growing of marijuana in very low population areas are issues in the region </p><br>

**Illicit drugs**<br>
<p>a significant drug trafficking and transit point between countries in South America and the United States; primary domestic use of narcotics is marijuana and some crack cocaine; a major source of precursor or essential chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics</p><br>
