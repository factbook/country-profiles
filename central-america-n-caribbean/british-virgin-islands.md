_Central America and Caribbean / Dependencies (United Kingdom)_

# British Virgin Islands

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
First inhabited by Arawak and later by Carib Indians, the Virgin Islands were settled by the Dutch in 1648 and then annexed by the English in 1672. The islands were part of the British colony of the Leeward Islands from 1872-1960; they were granted autonomy in 1967. The economy is closely tied to the larger and more populous US Virgin Islands to the west; the US dollar is the legal currency. On 6 September 2017, Hurricane Irma devastated the island of Tortola. An estimated 80% of residential and business structures were destroyed or damaged, communications disrupted, and local roads rendered impassable.<br>

## Economy

**Economic overview**<br>
<p>The economy, one of the most stable and prosperous in the Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism, which generates an estimated 45% of the national income. More than 934,000 tourists, mainly from the US, visited the islands in 2008. Because of traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as its currency since 1959.</p><p></p><p>Livestock raising is the most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements.</p><p></p><p>In the mid-1980s, the government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. Roughly 400,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, made the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business.</p><br>

_total subscriptions_: 35,163 (2020)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 116.3 (2020 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: good overall telephone service; major&nbsp;expansion sectors include the mobile telephony and data segments, which continue to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;operator investment;&nbsp;several operators licensed to provide services within individual markets, most of them are small and localized; telecommunication contributes to overall GDP (2020)<br>
_domestic_: fixed-line connections exceed 24 per 100 persons and mobile cellular subscribership is roughly 116 per 100 persons (2020)<br>
_international_: country code - 1-284; landing points for PCCS, ECFS, CBUS, Deep Blue Cable, East-West, PAN-AM, Americas-1, Southern Caribbean Fiber, Columbus- IIb, St Thomas - St Croix System, Taino-Carib, and Americas I- North&nbsp;via submarine cable to Caribbean, Central and South America, and US (2019)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced downturn, particularly in mobile device production; many network operators delayed upgrades to infrastructure; progress towards 5G implementation was postponed or slowed in some countries; consumer spending on telecom services and devices was affected by large-scale job losses and the consequent restriction on disposable incomes; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home became evident, and received some support from governments<br>
