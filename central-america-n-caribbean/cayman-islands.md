# Cayman Islands

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
The Cayman Islands were colonized from Jamaica by the British during the 18th and 19th centuries and were administered by Jamaica after 1863. In 1959, the islands became a territory within the Federation of the West Indies. When the Federation dissolved in 1962, the Cayman Islands chose to remain a British dependency. The territory has transformed itself into a significant offshore financial center.<br>

## Communications

**Telephones - fixed lines**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 33,338<br>

**Telephones - mobile cellular**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 92,691<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 152.5 (2019 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: reasonably good overall telephone system with a high fixed-line teledensity;&nbsp;given&nbsp;the high dependence of tourism and activities such as fisheries and offshore financial services, the telecom sector provides a relatively high contribution to overall GDP;&nbsp;good competition in all sectors promotes&nbsp;advancement in mobile telephony and data segments (2018)<br>
_domestic_: introduction of competition in the mobile-cellular market in 2004 boosted subscriptions dramatically; 55 per 100 fixed-line, 153 per 100 mobile-cellular (2019)<br>
_international_: country code - 1-345; landing points for the Maya-1, Deep Blue Cable, and the Cayman-Jamaica Fiber System submarine cables that provide links to the US and parts of Central and South America; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally; since 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced downturn, particularly in mobile device production; many network operators delayed upgrades to infrastructure; progress towards 5G implementation was postponed or slowed in some countries; consumer spending on telecom services and devices was affected by large-scale job losses and the consequent restriction on disposable incomes; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home became evident, and received some support from governments<br>

**Broadcast media**<br>
4 TV stations; cable and satellite subscription services offer a variety of international programming; government-owned Radio Cayman operates 2 networks broadcasting on 5 stations; 10 privately owned radio stations operate alongside Radio Cayman<br>
