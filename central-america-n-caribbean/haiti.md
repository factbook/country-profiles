## Introduction

**Background**<br>
<p>The native Taino - who inhabited the island of Hispaniola when Christopher COLUMBUS first landed on it in 1492 - were virtually wiped out by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island, which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean but relied heavily on the forced labor of enslaved Africans and environmentally degrading practices. In the late 18th century, Toussaint L'OUVERTURE led a revolution of Haiti's nearly half a million slaves that ended France's rule on the island. After a prolonged struggle, and under the leadership of Jean-Jacques DESSALINES, Haiti became the first country in the world led by former slaves after declaring its independence in 1804, but it was forced to pay an indemnity of 100 million francs (equivalent to $22 billion USD in March 2023) to France for more than a century and was shunned by other countries for nearly 40 years. On 12 July 1862, the US officially recognized Haiti, but foreign economic influence and internal political instability induced the US to occupy Haiti from 1915-1934. Subsequently, Francois "Papa Doc" DUVALIER and then his son Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" DUVALIER led repressive and corrupt regimes that ruled Haiti in 1957-1971 and 1971-1986, respectively. President Jovenel MOISE was assassinated on 7 July 2021, leading the country further into an extra-constitutional governance structure and contributing to the country’s growing fragility. On 20 July 2021, the Government of Haiti installed Ariel HENRY - whom President MOISE had nominated shortly before his death - as prime minister. As of March 2023, Haiti had no sitting elected officials. The country has long been plagued by natural disasters. In January 2010, a major 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti with an epicenter about 25 km (15 mi) west of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Estimates are that over 300,000 people were killed and some 1.5 million left homeless. The earthquake was assessed as the worst in this region over the last 200 years. A 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti’s southern peninsula in August 2021, causing well over 2,000 deaths; an estimated 500,000 required emergency humanitarian aid. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, as well as one of the most unequal in wealth distribution.</p><br>

_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 64 (2021 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: Haiti is in desperate need of maintaining effective communication services to enable it to keep going through the countless natural disasters, the country&rsquo;s telecoms sector is really only surviving on the back of international goodwill to repair and replace the systems destroyed in the latest upheaval; Haiti&rsquo;s fixed-line infrastructure is now practically non-existent, having been torn apart by Hurricane Matthew in 2016; what aid and additional investment has been forthcoming has been directed towards mobile solutions; over half of the country can afford a mobile handset or the cost of a monthly subscription; and mobile broadband subscriptions is half of that again &ndash; an estimated 28% in 2022; international aid continues to flow in to try and help the country&rsquo;s telecoms sector recover &ndash; the World Bank has released a further $120 million to go on top of the $60 million grant provided after the last major 7.2 earthquake in August 2021 (2022)<br>
_domestic_: fixed-line is less than 1 per 100; mobile-cellular teledensity is nearly 64 per 100 persons (2021)<br>
_international_: country code - 509; landing points for the BDSNi and Fibralink submarine cables to 14 points in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2019)<br>

**Broadcast media**<br>
<p>per 2019 data released by Haitian telecommunications regulator CONATEL (Conseil National des Télécommunications), there are 398 legal sound broadcasting stations on the territory, including about 60 community radio stations, and 7 radio stations on the AM band; the FM band in Haiti is oversaturated by 158 percent; most radio stations broadcast 17 to 19 hours a day; there are 105 television stations operating in Haiti, including 36 TV stations in Port- au- Prince, 41 others in the provinces, and more than 40 radio-television stations; a large number of broadcasting stations operate irregularly and some stations operate with technical parameters that do not comply with established standards, thus causing harmful interference to existing telecommunications systems; VOA Creole Service broadcasts daily on 30 affiliate stations</p> (2019)<br>

_number of registered air carriers_: 1 (2020)<br>
_inventory of registered aircraft operated by air carriers_: 1<br>

**Civil aircraft registration country code prefix**<br>
HH<br>

**Airports**<br>
14 (2021)<br>

**Airports - with paved runways**<br>
4<br>
<strong>note:</strong> paved runways have a concrete or asphalt surface but not all have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control; the length of a runway required for aircraft to safely operate depends on a number of factors including the type of aircraft, the takeoff weight (including passengers, cargo, and fuel), engine types, flap settings, landing speed, elevation of the airport, and average maximum daily air temperature; paved runways can reach a length of 5,000 m (16,000 ft.), but the “typical” length of a commercial airline runway is between 2,500-4,000 m (8,000-13,000 ft.)<br>

**Airports - with unpaved runways**<br>
10<br>
<strong>note:</strong> unpaved runways have a surface composition such as grass or packed earth and are most suited to the operation of light aircraft; unpaved runways are usually short, often less than 1,000 m (3,280 ft.) in length; airports with unpaved runways often lack facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control<br>

**Roadways**<br>
_total_: 4,102 km (2011)<br>
_paved_: 600 km (2011)<br>
_unpaved_: 3,502 km (2011)<br>

## Military and Security

**Military and security forces**<br>
the Haitian Armed Forces (FAdH), disbanded in 1995, began to be reconstituted in 2017; it established an Army command in 2018; Ministry of Justice and Public Security: Haitian National Police (Police Nationale d'Haïti or PNH) (2023)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> the PNH is responsible for maintaining public security; it includes police, corrections, fire, emergency response, airport security, port security, and coast guard functions; its units include a presidential guard and a paramilitary rapid-response Motorized Intervention Unit or BIM  <p class="gmail-css-axufdj"> </p><br>

**Military and security service personnel strengths**<br>
up to 2,000 military troops (the force is planned to eventually have around 5,000 personnel); estimates for the National Police range from a low of 9,000 to a high of about 13,000 (2023)<br>

**Military service age and obligation**<br>
not available<br>

**Military - note**<br>
according to the Haitian Government, the mission of the reconstituted armed forces will focus on patrolling the border with the Dominican Republic, combating smuggling, and executing recovery efforts after natural disasters<br><br>the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) operated in Haiti from 2004 until 2017; its mission was to help restore stability after President Bertrand ARISTIDE fled the country, including assisting with the political process, strengthening government institutions, and promoting and protecting human rights; following the completion of MINUSTAH’s mandate in 2017, a smaller peacekeeping mission, the UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH), operated until 2019; its mission was to assist with the further development and strengthening of the national police, as well as Haiti’s justice and prison systems, and to promote and protect human rights; in 2019, the UN established the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) with the political mission of advising the Haiti Government in elections, governance, and security; BINUH's current mandate last until July 2023 (2023)<br>

**Maritime threats**<br>
the International Maritime Bureau reported one incident in the territorial waters of Haiti in 2022, a decrease from the four attacks in 2021; ports in Haiti continue to be affected by the crime of armed robbery; most of these occurred in the main port of Port-au-Prince while ships were berthed or at anchor<br>

## Transnational Issues

**Disputes - international**<br>
<p>since 2004, peacekeepers from the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti have assisted in maintaining civil order in Haiti; the mission currently includes 6,685 military, 2,607 police, and 443 civilian personnel; despite efforts to control illegal migration, Haitians cross into the Dominican Republic and sail to neighboring countries; Haiti claims US-administered Navassa Island</p><br>

**Refugees and internally displaced persons**<br>

_stateless persons_: 2,992 (2018); note - individuals without a nationality who were born in the Dominican Republic prior to January 2010<br>

**Trafficking in persons**<br>
_tier rating_: Tier 2 Watch List &mdash; Haiti does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; Haiti adopted national standard operating procedures for victim identification and support, improved oversight of vulnerable children in orphanages, completed a new national action plan, conducted extensive anti-trafficking training, and collaborated with NGOs on victim identification; however, the government did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts compared with the previous year to expand its anti-trafficking capacity; traffickers operated with impunity and complicity, particularly in high-profile cases; no anti-trafficking law enforcement or victim protection efforts were reported apart from those involving children; the government did not fund the National Committee for the Fight Against Human Trafficking or adult victim services in fiscal year 2021 and made insufficient efforts to combat child domestic servitude; therefore, Haiti remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the second consecutive year (2022)<br>
_trafficking profile_: human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Haiti, as well as Haitians abroad; most of Haiti&rsquo;s trafficking cases involve children in forced labor and sex trafficking in domestic service; NGOs estimate between 150,000 and 300,000 children work in domestic servitude, of which about two-thirds are girls and one-third boys--mostly victims of sex trafficking and labor trafficking, respectively; Haitian women and girls seeking jobs are instead exploited in commercial sex in the Dominican Republic or for sex tourism; child sex tourism reportedly takes place in Haiti, with most tourists coming from the United States, Canada, and Europe; traffickers target Haitian children in private or NGO-sponsored residential care centers, children working in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, internally displaced persons&mdash;including those displaced by natural disasters and gang violence&mdash;stateless people, Haitian migrants traveling from or returning to Haiti, and LGBTQI+ youth; female foreign nationals, especially from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, are particularly at risk for sex and labor trafficking in Haiti; Cuban medical workers in Haiti may have been forced to work by the Cuban government (2022)<br>

**Illicit drugs**<br>
<p>a transit point for cocaine from South America and marijuana from Jamaica en route to the United States; not a producer or large consumer of illicit drugs; some cultivation of cannabis for local consumption</p><br>
