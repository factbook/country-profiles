# Hong Kong

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Seized by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by China the following year at the end of the First Opium War; the Kowloon Peninsula was added in 1860 at the end of the Second Opium War, and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. In this agreement, China promised that, under its "one country, two systems" formula, China's socialist economic and strict political system would not be imposed on Hong Kong and that Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for the subsequent 50 years. <br><br>Since the turnover, Hong Kong has continued to enjoy success as an international financial center. However, dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong Government and growing Chinese political influence has been a central issue and led to considerable civil unrest, including large-scale pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019 after the HKSAR attempted to revise a local ordinance to allow extraditions to mainland China. In response, the governments of the HKSAR and China took several actions that reduced the city's autonomy and placed new restrictions on the rights of Hong Kong residents, moves that were widely criticized to be in direct contravention of obligations under the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Chief among these actions was a sweeping national security law for Hong Kong imposed by the Chinese Government in June 2020 that criminalized acts such as those interpreted as secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign or external forces. The law ushered in a widespread crackdown on public protests, criticism of authorities, and freedom of speech, and was used by authorities to target pro-democracy activists, organizations, and media companies. Democratic lawmakers and political figures were arrested, while others fled abroad. At the same time, dozens of civil society groups and several independent media outlets were closed or have disbanded. In March 2021, Beijing imposed a more restrictive electoral system, including restructuring the Legislative Council (LegCo) and allowing only government-approved candidates to run for office, claiming it was to ensure a system of "patriots" governed Hong Kong. The changes ensured that virtually all seats in the December 2021 LegCo election were won by pro-establishment candidates and effectively ended political opposition to Beijing in the territory.<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: Hong Kong&rsquo;s telecommunications sector continues to stay near the top of world rankings for the industry; it has kept its #1 spot in the Asian region in terms of the maturity of its telecom market &ndash; a reflection of the high penetration rates across mobile, mobile broadband, and fixed broadband; even fixed-line teledensity in Hong Kong is impressive at over 50%, although it too has started a gradual decline in keeping with most other telecom markets around the world, as consumers slowly transition over to the mobile platform for all of their communication needs (2022)<br>

## Transnational Issues

**Disputes - international**<br>
<p>Hong Kong plans to reduce its 2,800-hectare Frontier Closed Area (FCA) to 400 hectares by 2015; the FCA was established in 1951 as a buffer zone between Hong Kong and mainland China to prevent illegal migration from and the smuggling of goods</p><br>

**Trafficking in persons**<br>
_tier rating_: Tier 2 Watch List &mdash; Hong Kong does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; the government trained more officials, prosecuted more employers of foreign domestic workers for crimes including assault, and reported increased actions against illegal brothels and perpetrators who solicit child sex trafficking victims; however, officials did not demonstrate overall increased efforts in anti-trafficking capacity and did not prosecute or convict any traffickers; criminals convicted for sex trafficking crimes received inadequate penalties, and the government did not enact legislation to fully criminalize all forms of trafficking; fewer victims were identified, and ineffective implementation of victim identification continued to result in inadequate victim identification and penalizing victims for unlawful acts traffickers compelled them to commit; because the government has devoted sufficient resources to a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards, Hong Kong was granted a waiver per the TVPA from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3; therefore, Hong Kong remained on Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year (2022)<br>
_trafficking profile_: human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Hong Kong, and traffickers exploit victims from Hong Kong abroad; victims include citizens from mainland China, Indonesia, Kenya, the Philippines, Thailand, Uganda, and other Southeast Asian countries, as well as countries in South Asia, Africa, and South America; foreign women, including from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia are exploited in sex trafficking; traffickers exploit migrant workers in shipping, construction, electronic recycling, nursing homes, and private homes; foreign women are coerced to carry drugs into Hong Kong; some women in Hong Kong&ndash;often with the assistance of their families&ndash;deceive Indian and Pakistani men into arranged marriages involving forced domestic service, bonded labor in construction, and other physically demanding industries; traffickers recruit victims from the Philippines, South America, and mainland China under false pretenses and forced them into commercial sex (2022)<br>

**Illicit drugs**<br>
<p>modern banking system provides conduit for money laundering; groups involved in money laundering range from local street organizations to sophisticated international syndicates involved in assorted criminal activities, including drug trafficking; major source of precursor chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics</p><br>
