# Paracel Islands

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932, French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island. China has occupied all the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. China built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield and artificial harbor, and it has scattered garrisons on some of the other islands. Taiwan and Vietnam also claim the Paracel Islands.<br>

## Environment

**Environment - current issues**<br>
China's use of dredged sand and coral to build artificial islands harms reef systems; ongoing human activities, including military operations, infrastructure construction, and tourism endangers local ecosystem including birds, fish, marine mammals, and marine reptiles<br>

**Climate**<br>
tropical<br>

**Land use**<br>
_other_: 100% (2018 est.)<br>

## Government

**Country name**<br>

_conventional short form_: Paracel Islands<br>
