_Europe / Dependencies (Denmark)_

# Faroe Islands

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
The Faroe Islands were already populated by ca. A.D. 500, but whether the settlers were Celtic or early Norse (or someone else) has yet to be determined. The islands served as an important stepping stone for Medieval Viking exploration of the North Atlantic and Viking settlers arrived on the islands in the 9th century. The islands have been connected politically to Denmark since the 14th century and today the Faroe Islands are a self-governing dependency of Denmark. The Home Rule Act of 1948 granted a high degree of self-government to the Faroese, who have autonomy over most internal affairs and external trade, while Denmark is responsible for justice, defense, and some foreign affairs. The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union.<br>
