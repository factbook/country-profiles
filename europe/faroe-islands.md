_Europe / Dependencies (Denmark)_

# Faroe Islands

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
The Faroe Islands were already populated by ca. A.D. 500, but whether the settlers were Celtic or early Norse (or someone else) has yet to be determined. The islands served as an important stepping stone for Medieval Viking exploration of the North Atlantic and Viking settlers arrived on the islands in the 9th century. The islands have been connected politically to Denmark since the 14th century and today the Faroe Islands are a self-governing dependency of Denmark. The Home Rule Act of 1948 granted a high degree of self-government to the Faroese, who have autonomy over most internal affairs and external trade, while Denmark is responsible for justice, defense, and some foreign affairs. The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union.<br>

## Transportation

**National air transport system**<br>

1<br>
<strong>note:</strong> paved runways have a concrete or asphalt surface but not all have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control; the length of a runway required for aircraft to safely operate depends on a number of factors including the type of aircraft, the takeoff weight (including passengers, cargo, and fuel), engine types, flap settings, landing speed, elevation of the airport, and average maximum daily air temperature; paved runways can reach a length of 5,000 m (16,000 ft.), but the “typical” length of a commercial airline runway is between 2,500-4,000 m (8,000-13,000 ft.)<br>

**Roadways**<br>
_total_: 960 km (2017)<br>
_paved_: 500 km (2017)<br>
