_North America / Dependencies (United Kingdom)_

# Bermuda

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English colonists heading for Virginia. Self-governing since 1620, Bermuda is the oldest and most populous of the British overseas territories. Vacationing to the island to escape North American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be important to the island's economy, although international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has also developed into a highly successful offshore financial center. A referendum on independence from the UK was soundly defeated in 1995.<br>

## Communications

**Telephones - fixed lines**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 25,000 (2021 est.)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 39 (2021 est.)<br>

**Telephones - mobile cellular**<br>
_total subscriptions_: 68,000 (2021 est.)<br>
_subscriptions per 100 inhabitants_: 110 (2021 est.)<br>

**Telecommunication systems**<br>
_general assessment_: the telecom sector has seen a decline in subscriber numbers (particularly for prepaid mobile services the mainstay of short term visitors) and revenue; fixed and mobile broadband services are two areas that have benefited from the crisis as employees and students have resorted to working from home; one area of the telecom market that is not prepared for growth is 5G mobile; governments, regulators, and even the mobile network operators have shown that they have not been investing in 5G opportunities at the present time; network expansion and enhancements remain concentrated around improving LTE coverage (2021)<br>
_domestic_: the system has a fixed-line teledensity of 39 per 100, coupled with a mobile-cellular teledensity of roughly 110 per 100 persons (2021)<br>
_international_: country code - 1-441; landing points for the GlobeNet, Gemini Bermuda, CBUS, and the CB-1 submarine cables to the Caribbean, South America and the US; satellite earth stations - 3 (2019)<br>

## Transportation

**Civil aircraft registration country code prefix**<br>
VP-B<br>

**Airports**<br>
1 (2021)<br>

**Airports - with paved runways**<br>
1<br>
<strong>note:</strong> paved runways have a concrete or asphalt surface but not all have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control; the length of a runway required for aircraft to safely operate depends on a number of factors including the type of aircraft, the takeoff weight (including passengers, cargo, and fuel), engine types, flap settings, landing speed, elevation of the airport, and average maximum daily air temperature; paved runways can reach a length of 5,000 m (16,000 ft.), but the “typical” length of a commercial airline runway is between 2,500-4,000 m (8,000-13,000 ft.)<br>

**Roadways**<br>
_total_: 447 km (2010)<br>
_paved_: 447 km (2010)<br>
<strong>note:</strong> 225 km public roads; 222 km private roads<br>
