# United States

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
<p>Thirteen of Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries, 37 new states were added as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. Two of the most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s, an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II, the economy has achieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment, and rapid advances in technology.</p><br>

North America<br>

**Area**<br>
_total _: 9,833,517 sq km<br>
_land_: 9,147,593 sq km<br>
_water_: 685,924 sq km<br>
<strong>note:</strong> includes only the 50 states and District of Columbia, no overseas territories<br>

**Area - comparative**<br>
about half the size of Russia; about three-tenths the size of Africa; about half the size of South America (or slightly larger than Brazil); slightly larger than China; more than twice the size of the European Union<br>

**Land boundaries**<br>
_total_: 12,002 km<br>
_border countries_: Canada 8,891 km (including 2,475 km with Alaska); Mexico 3,111 km<br>

**Coastline**<br>
19,924 km<br>

**Maritime claims**<br>
_territorial sea_: 12 nm<br>
_contiguous zone_: 24 nm<br>
_exclusive economic zone_: 200 nm<br>
_continental shelf_: not specified<br>

**Climate**<br>
mostly temperate, but tropical in Hawaii and Florida, arctic in Alaska, semiarid in the great plains west of the Mississippi River, and arid in the Great Basin of the southwest; low winter temperatures in the northwest are ameliorated occasionally in January and February by warm chinook winds from the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains<br>
<strong>note:</strong> many consider Mount McKinley, the highest peak in the United States, to be the world’s coldest mountain because of its combination of high elevation and its subarctic location at 63 degrees north latitude; permanent snow and ice cover over 75 percent of the mountain, and enormous glaciers, up to 45 miles long and 3,700 feet thick, spider out from its base in every direction; it is home to some of the world’s coldest and most violent weather, where winds of over 150 miles per hour and temperatures of -93˚F have been recorded.<br>

**Terrain**<br>
vast central plain, mountains in west, hills and low mountains in east; rugged mountains and broad river valleys in Alaska; rugged, volcanic topography in Hawaii<br>

**Elevation**<br>
_highest point_: Mount McKinley 6,190 m (highest point in North America)<br>
_lowest point_: Death Valley (lowest point in North America) -86 m<br>
_mean elevation_: 760 m<br>
<strong>note: </strong>Mount McKinley is one of the most striking features on the entire planet; at 20,310 feet, it is the crowning peak of the Alaska Range and the highest mountain on North America; it towers three and one-half vertical miles above its base, making it a mile taller from base to summit than Mt. Everest; McKinley's base sits at about 2,000 feet above sea level and rises over three and one-half miles to its 20,310 foot summit; Everest begins on a 14,000-foot high plain, then summits at 29,028 feet.<strong><br>note:</strong> the peak of Mauna Kea (4,207 m above sea level) on the island of Hawaii rises about 10,200 m above the Pacific Ocean floor; by this measurement, it is the world's tallest mountain -- higher than Mount Everest (8,850 m), which is recognized as the tallest mountain above sea level<br>

**Military expenditures**<br>
3.4% of GDP (2024 est.)<br>
3.2% of GDP (2023)<br>
3.3% of GDP (2022)<br>

**Military equipment inventories and acquisitions**<br>
the US military's inventory is comprised almost entirely of domestically produced weapons systems (some assembled with foreign components) along with a smaller mix of imported equipment from a variety of countries such as Germany and the UK; the US defense industry is capable of designing, developing, maintaining, and producing the full spectrum of weapons systems; the US is the world's leading arms exporter (2024)<br>

**Military service age and obligation**<br>
17 years of age (under 18 with parental consent) for voluntary service for men and women; maximum enlistment age 35 (Army), 42 (Air Force/Space Force), 41 (Navy), 28 (Marines), 41 (Coast Guard); 8-year service obligation, including 2-5 years active duty depending on the particular military service  (2025)<br>
<strong>note 1: </strong>the US military has been all-volunteer since 1973, but an act of Congress can reinstate the draft in case of a national emergency; males aged 18-25 must register with Selective Service<br><strong><br>note 2:</strong> all military occupations and positions open to women; in 2022, women comprised 17.5% of the total US regular military personnel<br><br><strong>note 3:</strong> non-citizens living permanently and legally in the US may join as enlisted personnel; they must have permission to work in the US, a high school diploma, and speak, read, and write English fluently; under the Compact of Free Association, citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands may volunteer<br>

**Military deployments**<br>
