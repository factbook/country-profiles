# Southern Ocean

## Introduction

**Background**<br>
A large body of recent oceanographic research has shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica, plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation. The region where the cold waters of the ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border -- the Antarctic Convergence -- which fluctuates with the seasons but encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region. The Convergence concentrates nutrients, which promotes marine plant life, which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life. In 2000, the International Hydrographic Organization delimited the waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean basin -- the Southern Ocean -- by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude, which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty region and which approximates the extent of the Antarctic Convergence. As such, the Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five ocean basins (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean). It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does not imply US Government recognition of this feature as one of the world's primary ocean basins.<br>

## Geography

**Location**<br>
body of water between 60 degrees south latitude and Antarctica<br>

**Geographic coordinates**<br>
60 00 S, 90 00 E (nominally), but the Southern Ocean has the unique distinction of being a large circumpolar body of water totally encircling the continent of Antarctica; this ring of water lies between 60 degrees south latitude and the coast of Antarctica and encompasses 360 degrees of longitude<br>

**Map references**<br>
Antarctic Region<br>

**Area**<br>
_total _: 21.96 million sq km<br>
<strong>note:</strong> includes Amundsen Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, part of the Drake Passage, Ross Sea, a small part of the Scotia Sea, Weddell Sea, and other tributary water bodies<br>

**Area - comparative**<br>
slightly more than twice the size of the US<br>

**Coastline**<br>
17,968 km<br>

**Climate**<br>
sea temperatures vary from about 10 degrees Celsius to -2 degrees Celsius; cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently are intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean; the ocean area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth; in winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius; at some coastal points intense persistent drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter<br>

**Ocean volume**<br>
_ocean volume_: 71.8 million cu km<br>
_percent of World Ocean total volume_: 5.4%<br>

**Major ocean currents**<br>
<p>the cold, clockwise-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (West Wind Drift; 21,000 km long) moves perpetually eastward around the continent and is the world's largest and strongest ocean current, transporting 130 million cubic meters of water per second - 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers; it is also the only current that flows all the way around the planet and connects the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean basins; the cold Antarctic Coastal Current (East Wind Drift) is the southernmost current in the world, flowing westward and parallel to the Antarctic coastline</p><br>

**Bathymetry**<br>
_continental shelf_: the following are examples of features found on the continental shelf of the Southern Ocean (see Figure 2):<br><br>Astrid Ridge (see also Figure 4)<br>Belgrano Bank<br>Gunnerus Ridge (see also Figure 4)<br>Hayes Bank<br>Iselin Bank<br>
_continental slope_: the following are examples of features found on the continental slope of the Southern Ocean (see Figure 2):<br><br>Amery Basin (Figure 4)<br>Filchner Trough<br>Hillary Canyon<br>Pobeda Canyon (Figure 3)<br>
_abyssal plains_: the following are examples of features found on the abyssal plains of the Southern Ocean (see Figures 2, 3, and 4):<br><br>Amundsen (Abyssal) Plain<br>Enderby (Abyssal) Plain<br>South Indian/Australian-Antarctic Basin<br>Southeast Pacific/Bellinghausen Basin<br>Weddell (Abyssal) Plain<br>
_mid-ocean ridge_: the following are examples of mid-ocean ridges found on the floor of the Southern Ocean (see Figure 2):<br><br>Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (Figure 3)<br>
_undersea terrain features_: the following are examples of undersea terrain features found on the floor of the Southern Ocean (see Figure 2):<br><br>Akopov Seamounts (Figure 3)<br>De Gerlache Seamounts (see also Figure 3, 4)<br>Endurance Ridge (Figure 4)<br>Marie Byrd Seamount (see also Figure 3)<br>Maud Rise (see also Figure 4)<br>Scott Seamounts (see also Figure 3)<br>
_ocean trenches_: <p>the following are examples of ocean trenches found on the floor of the Southern Ocean (see Figure 2):<br><br>South Sandwich Trench (Figure 4; the deepest location in the Southern Ocean)</p><br>
_atolls_: due to the extremely cold water, there are no atolls in the Southern Ocean<br>

**Elevation**<br>
_highest point_: sea level<br>
_lowest point_: southern end of the South Sandwich Trench -7,434 m unnamed deep<br>
_mean depth_: -3,270 m<br>
_ocean zones_: Composed of water and in a fluid state, the ocean is delimited differently than the solid continents. It is divided into three zones based on depth and light level. Sunlight entering the water may travel about 1,000 m into the oceans under the right conditions, but there is rarely any significant light beyond 200 m.<br><br>The upper 200 m (656 ft) of the ocean is called the euphotic, or "sunlight," zone. This zone contains the vast majority of commercial fisheries and is home to many protected marine mammals and sea turtles. Only a small amount of light penetrates beyond this depth. <br><br>The zone between 200 m (656 ft) and 1,000 m (3,280 ft) is usually referred to as the "twilight" zone, but is officially the dysphotic zone. In this zone, the intensity of light rapidly dissipates as depth increases. Such a minuscule amount of light penetrates beyond a depth of 200 m that photosynthesis is no longer possible.<br><br>The aphotic, or "midnight," zone exists in depths below 1,000 m (3,280 ft). Sunlight does not penetrate to these depths, and the zone is bathed in darkness.<br>

**Natural resources**<br>
probable large oil and gas fields on the continental margin; manganese nodules, possible placer deposits, sand and gravel, fresh water as icebergs; krill, fish<br>

**Natural hazards**<br>
huge icebergs with drafts up to several hundred meters; smaller bergs and iceberg fragments; sea ice (generally 0.5 to 1 m thick) with sometimes dynamic short-term variations and with large annual and interannual variations; deep continental shelf floored by glacial deposits varying widely over short distances; high winds and large waves much of the year; ship icing, especially May-October; most of region is remote from sources of search and rescue<br>

**Geography - note**<br>
the major chokepoint is the Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica; the Polar Front (Antarctic Convergence) is the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean; it is a distinct region at the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that separates the cold polar surface waters to the south from the warmer waters to the north; the Front and the Current extend entirely around Antarctica, reaching south of 60 degrees south near New Zealand and near 48 degrees south in the far South Atlantic, coinciding with the path of the maximum westerly winds<br>

## Environment

**Environment - current issues**<br>
natural and man-made changes to the ocean's physical, chemical, and biological systems&nbsp;<br>

**Environment - international agreements**<br>
the Southern Ocean is subject to all international agreements regarding the world's oceans; in addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the Antarctic region: International Whaling Commission (prohibits commercial whaling south of 40 degrees south [south of 60 degrees south between 50 degrees and 130 degrees west]); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (limits sealing); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (regulates fishing)<br> <p><strong>note:</strong> mineral exploitation except for scientific research is banned by the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty; additionally, many nations (including the US) prohibit mineral resource exploration and exploitation south of the fluctuating Polar Front (Antarctic Convergence), which is in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north</p><br>

**Climate**<br>
sea temperatures vary from about 10 degrees Celsius to -2 degrees Celsius; cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently are intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean; the ocean area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth; in winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius; at some coastal points intense persistent drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter<br>

**Marine fisheries**<br>
the Southern Ocean fishery is relatively small with a total catch of 388,901 mt in 2021; the Food and Agriculture Organization has delineated three regions in the Southern Ocean (Regions 48, 58, 88) that generally encompass the waters south of 40° to 60° South latitude; the most important producers in these regions include Norway (241,408 mt), China (47,605 mt), and South Korea (39,487 mt); Antarctic krill made up 95.5% of the total catch in 2021, while other important species include Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish<br><br><strong>Regional fisheries bodies:</strong> Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources<br>

## Government

**Country name**<br>
_etymology_: the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) has not formally adopted the definition of the Southern Ocean as the waters south of 60 degrees south; the definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition of the IHO's <em>Names and Limits of Oceans and Seas</em> in 2002 and has since become the de facto name for many nations and organizations, including the CIA<br>
